I have been coding a flask app that will filter a dataset based on a changing input. The html returns the filter class and value to the python, the python should filter based off of this input and then return a json response which is displayed on the page. When the output must be less than zero or a negative number then the filter returns a pair of empty brackets when there is still data that meets the criteria. Ex. when looking for a item that has a price change of less than zero and a Item in the data set has a number of -2 it will return a pair of brackets []. When looking for a item with a price change of less than one it will only send back items with price changes 1-0 and not go into the negatives even if there is one. I am completely lost and have no clue why it does this. I have checked dev tools and it shows flask sending the filter correctly, but only received []. Please help here is a link to my git repo with my html,json data, and python.
